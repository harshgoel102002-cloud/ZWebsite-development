            <p class="fade-in-scroll">ZARVETON was founded on a simple observation: glassware should feel deliberate. Not inherited, not decorative, but chosen with the same intention as the table itself. We design pieces that bring balance to hosting — through weight, clarity, and finish.</p>

                    <h3>Craft without drama</h3>
                    <p>We believe in precision over spectacle. Every piece is designed to perform quietly — clear glass, balanced weight, refined edges. The details speak for themselves, without excess.</p>

                    <h3>Balance in form</h3>
                    <p>A glass should feel right in hand. Not too light, not too heavy. The proportions matter because they affect how guests experience the moment. We design for stability, sight lines, and the ritual of use.</p>

                    <h3>Hosting as intention</h3>
                    <p>Tables are where care becomes visible. The glassware you choose signals how you approach gathering. ZARVETON is for those who see hosting as more than hospitality — it's a form of consideration.</p>
